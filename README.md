# My Personal Knowledge Base & Second Brain

:brain: Welcome to my Second Brain.

This repository is my commitment to a lifelong journey of learning in technology. It's not just a collection of notes, but a structured, searchable, and personalized system for processing and solidifying knowledge.

This will be the most valuable and long-lasting project of my career.

## 记笔记的原则 (Note-Taking Principles)

Every note in this repository should be concise, practical, and, most importantly, written in my own words. I will follow the **"3W1H" principle**:

* **What (是什么):** What is this concept? A clear, simple definition.
* **Why (为什么):** Why is it important? What problem does it solve?
* **When (什么时候用):** In what specific scenarios would I use this?
* **How (怎么用):** A minimal, runnable code snippet that I have personally verified.

### :treasure_chest: 我的宝藏：问题解决日志 (My Treasure: The Problem-Solving Log)

* **[99_Problem_Solving_Log](./99_Problem_Solving_Log/)**
    > This is the most valuable section. It contains a chronological log of real-world problems I've encountered and how I solved them. Each file is a story, a lesson, and a future interview answer.

## 开始第一条笔记 (Starting the First Note)

My first action is to create the first entry in my log:
`99_Problem_Solving_Log/2025-07-18_How_To_Start_A_Knowledge_Base.md`

This will document the structure and principles I've learned from this initial setup process.
